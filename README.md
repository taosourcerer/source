## Mission

A perfect reasoner could deduce some things about the world even before receiving any empirical data.
How would that _prior model_ look like?
Our goal is to answer that question.
In doing so, we are constructing a philosophical system which unifies all theoretical knowledge.
There is a natural way in which all of knowledge gracefully folds together.
The number of reasonable ways of thinking about the world is limited.
It is possible to construct a system which is optimal.
This system provides an organizing principle for creating new knowledge.

The output this project is a document: [source.pdf](https://github.com/taosourcerer/source/blob/master/source.pdf)
The document presents a worldview.
Each worldview solves some problems, creates some new problems and brings some assumptions.
Our goal is to construct a worldview which solves more problems, creates fewer new problems, and brings as few assumptions as possible.
The problems we solve are aimed to be important and hard.
The problems we create are aimed to be well defined so they can be attacked by using the tools of mathematics.
The assumptions we bring are aimed to be minimal.
Out of all possible worldviews, our goal is to select the one which makes the most sense.

Ideas should be presented clearly.
Questions should be asked before they are answered.
Problems should be posed before solutions are presented.
Terms should be defined before they are used.
Technical explanations should be accompanied by examples.
Where possible, the examples should be visual.
Where possible, code snippets should be provided.
The language used in the document is aimed to be simple and short.
The exposition of ideas is aimed to be as direct as possible.

## Vision

### First principles thinking

Our view of the world used to be different.
Zeus caused thunder.
The Earth was flat, and it was the center of the universe.
Fire was caused by a substance called [phlogiston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phlogiston_theory).
Light travelled through a substance called [aether](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminiferous_aether).
Everything we think we know could turn out to be false.
Our brains are built from unreliable hardware and they produce unreliable beliefs and predictions.
Could have we avoided the mistakes of the past?
What is the optimal algorithm for generating knowledge?
Start with the most basic assumptions, and build from that.
It turns out, a lot can be done that way.
Thinking from first principles leads to a change of perspective in which previously unreachable ideas become thinkable.
What seemed like a paradox suddenly becomes dissolved. 
As when the work of [Euclid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_series#Euclid) solved the Zeno's [dichotomy paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeno%27s_paradoxes#Dichotomy_paradox) by inventing the mathematical concept of a geometric series.
Mathematical formalization is crucial in order to solve hard problems.
This is what makes _Source_ different from most other philosophical texts, as does inclusion of working source code.
Our goal is to transmute philosophy into math and code.

### Unification

Our civilization has been around for about 10,000 years.
During that period, a lot of knowledge has been accumulated.
Some of that is knowledge of specifics, such as the layout of the streets of some city, or when in time some event happened.
Other knowledge is that of abstractions, the ways in which reality is structured, the root causes of events, the mechanisms which determine how things behave.
Our abstract knowledge is divided into philosophy, mathematics, algorithms, physics, chemistry, biology, economics, etc.
Yet, a unifying picture of how it all fits together is nowhere to be found.
The interfaces between different fields remain undescribed.
Thinking from first principles leads to an unbroken thread of implications.
Following this thread, insights from a wide range of different fields emerge, naturally integrated.
Areas of our knowledge are not islands which are loosely connected to each other, but knowledge is a solid block which we carved into separate areas only to make it easier to study.
This project aims to present a unified picture of the world.
There is a difference between being able to build parts of a car and being able to build a whole working car.
The difference is, among other things, in the questions you ask.
Our goal is a worldview which compiles and runs correctly.

### Value optimization

As you gain more knowledge, each new piece of information you encounter becomes less valuable.
Twenty percent of the theory often brings eighty percent of the benefit.
Those insights are usually concentrated at the introductory level, but in many cases they are widely scattered and obscure.
Our goal is to stick only with the most important insights and to collect them in one place.
This way the document tries to provide the highest value per page while still being easy to understand.

### Memory compression

Since our memory is not perfect and we have a limited amount of it, knowledge decays.
In order to solve that problem, knowledge needs to be compressed into key axioms and insights.
Or it can be compressed into knowing the right questions to ask and an intuition about the direction in which to move in order to deduce the answer.
That way, even if something is forgotten it can be reinvented.
You don't understand X if you can't write a program which does X.
You also don't understand X if you can't deduce X from first principles.
Some insights are so elegant and deep that by the sheer force of their beauty they cannot be forgetten.
Our goal is to ask the right questions and to build good intuition.

### Belief propagation

Our beliefs always have some implications we are not aware of.
Given more time, absent any new evidence, there are still conclusions we could deduce by thinking alone.
Our knowledge is connected like a network.
When you learn about topic X, it should change what you think about other topics which are connected to X.
The process of implication propagation is not automatic, it is intentional, and driven by concrete needs to solve problems.
Source creates a structure which connects all of knowledge.
This structure offers a natural traversal of knowledge, a flowing sequence of questions and answers.
It provides a way to systematically propagate implications.

### Inferential distance reduction

Our species lived through a number of revolutions in information technology.
The first one was the invention of language.
Prior to that communication was very limited indeed, there was no capacity for culture.
The next revolution was writing, necessary for civilization.
Then math, necessary for technology.
Then computation, necessary for advanced technology.
Each revolution depended on the previous one having taken place.
What is the next revolution?

To explain why the Earth is round to someone without any knowledge of science and mathematics would be a long conversation.
It would involve talking about what evidence is, what Occam's razor is, what models are, what natural laws are, etc.
The lack of shared knowledge between two people sometimes demands that hundreds of ideas and concepts be communicated before any mutual understanding is possible.
This difference of shared knowledge between people is called _inferential distance_, and it is usually underestimated.
Our education system produces some amount of shared knowledge, but far below what is needed to seriously talk about the most important problems in the world today.
The list of things all should know about needs to include Solomonoff induction, von Neumann–Morgenstern utility theorem, Nash equilibrium, and many others.
Source leads to a simple and natural way to organize all of knowledge.
This brings about a shared perspective and a shared language, reducing the inferential distance.
This project should lead to a clearer understanding of what knowledge is and how it is generated in society.

> The ancients who wished to illustrate the highest virtue throughout the empire first ordered well their own states. Wishing to order well their states, they first regulated their families. Wishing to regulate their families, they first cultivated their own selves. Wishing to cultivate their own selves, they first rectified their hearts. Wishing to rectify their hearts, they first sought to be sincere in their thoughts. Wishing to be sincere in their thoughts, they first extended to the utmost their knowledge. Things being investigated, knowledge became complete. Their knowledge being complete, their thoughts were sincere. Their thoughts being sincere, their hearts were then rectified. Their hearts being rectified, their persons were cultivated. Their persons being cultivated, their families were regulated. Their families being regulated, their states were rightly governed. Their states being rightly governed, the whole kingdom was made tranquil and happy.  
> — Confucius

### Metaphysics

The conclusions reached here should not depend on any specific law of physics.
It is something an artificial general intelligence could think up before ever _opening their eyes_, with no empirical data.
I think, therefore I am... a structure embedded in a larger structure, an agent embedded in a universe which supports the existence of bounded-tape Turing machines.
Our goal is a metaphysical theory of everything.

### Beauty

There are insights which radically change our view the world.
Some change our view about the basic building blocks of reality, or about which ways of thinking make sense.
We call such insights ontological refactoring.
Those most important insights include quantum mechanics, the concept of spacetime, mathematical proof and computation.
Playing with _Source_, you find yourself asking questions like: is there a string which can't be computed by a Turing machine?
Not just because theoretical computer science is beautiful but because you _need_ the answer to solve some particular problem posed by the theory.
Source illuminates why certain questions in math are important.

Our goals are very ambitious but we are still very far from achieving them.

> I have wished to understand the hearts of men. I have wished to know why the stars shine. And I have tried to apprehend the Pythagorean power by which number holds sway above the flux. A little of this, but not much, I have achieved.  
> — Bertrand Russell

If we don't try, they will never be achieved. 

> Stripped of any intellectual pretension, philosophy just grapples with the ancient, heartfelt questions _What the fuck is going on here?_ and _What the fuck am I doing here?_ — what is the nature of reality, and what is the nature and purpose (if any) of our place in it? We all strive to answer such questions somehow or other. Here goes one more try.  
> — Gary Drescher

## Society

### Bias

Agents with different utility functions have an incentive to hide or distort the truth from each other.
Marketing is an example of a financial incentive.
Propaganda is an example of a state governance incentive.
All research is funded by someone, be it a corporation or a government.
Even if there is no communication between the funder and the recipient, the recipient is implicitly incentivized not to cause harm to the funder.
Do not bite the hand that feeds you.
Outright lies are not necessary, it is enough to ignore a subset of the data, i.e. to cherry pick.
One elegant way to hide information is to simply make the data hard or impossible to access.
Another is to make it needlessly hard to understand.
The more complex the phenomena is, the easier it is to cherry pick.
Since all data is subject to cherry picking, what would happen if we would just to ignore all data?
A metaphysical theory of everything would happen.
Anything which depends on empirical data is hard to verify.
Deduction from axioms can be verified easily.

### Science

Some people claim to base their worldview on science.
This is impossible, since science is incomplete.
It leaves many problems open, as evident from philosophy of science.
Science does not inform you what to study at the university, what job to appy to, where to invest, and in general what do do in life.
To do that, you need to either rely on intuition or you can construct a probability distribution on models and estimate the expected utility.
Either way, you can't make a randomized controlled trial about it.
You need to take into accout many small things which can't be measured, yet they still can, and need to, be modelled.
There is a large amount of misunderstanding of why science works, when it works.
In general, people often place statements into two distinct sets, proven and unproven.
On things which are deemed proven, if you disagree with science then you are judged as a fool.
On things which are deemed unproven, you are not allowed to have an opinion about them.
Talking about things which are "not known" is deemed as speculation, it is _faux pas_ in most educated circles.
Yet still it is clear to anyone that playing Russian roulette is not a good choice if you wish to stay alive; even though it is not _known_ if you will die from it or not.
Lack of deterministic knowledge about X is not a reason to stop thinking about X.
There are no proven and unproven statements, instead there are models and a probability distribution on them.

### Intellectuals

Arguments are not isolated.
We can't talk about anything without talking about the entire universe.
Any discussion, if it's honest and goes on long enough, is bound to either run in circles, or to regress infinitely, or to reach the fundamental axioms of worldviews.
Intellectuals are biased when it comes to topics they talk about; there is always some new fashionable topic.
Once some public discussion comes near the axioms the topic is usually switched to something else.
To reach any clear conclusion it is necessary to talk about the fundamentals.

### Spirituality

There exists an eternal structure which is the cause of all phenomena and permeates all being.
You can, at least in part, become one with that structure and in that way achieve immortality.
There exists an optimal way to systemize knowledge.
It is bound to be rediscovered over and over again by intelligent agents.
Even if they are in universes with laws of nature different than ours, they will converge on discovering the same structure.

## Motivation

> Have you ever experienced a moment of bliss? On the rapids of inspiration maybe, your mind tracing the shapes of truth and beauty? Or in the pulsing ecstasy of love? Or in a glorious triumph achieved with true friends? Or in a conversation on a vine-overhung terrace one star-appointed night? Or perhaps a melody smuggled itself into your heart, charming it and setting it alight with kaleidoscopic emotions? Or when you prayed, and felt heard? If you have experienced such a moment – experienced the best type of such a moment – then you may have discovered inside it a certain idle but sincere thought: “Heaven, yes! I didn’t realize it could be like this. This is so right, on whole different level of right; so real, on a whole different level of real. Why can’t it be like this always? Before I was sleeping; now I am awake.”  
> — Nick Bostrom

What do people want? Everything we do, we do because we wish to update the state of our mind to some other state: 
1. Short term updates. Example: food. Money can buy that.
2. Long term trajectories in mind-space. Example: health. Money can buy that to a certain extent.
3. Updates of the third kind, such as spiritual experiences, producing art, experiencing art.

The key property the updates of the third kind have is independance from external rewards and hence they allow you to escape the incentive gradients in which you are societially embedded.

This project also has a number of desireable properties:
1. It is infinite. Once you achieve some finite goal, in order to be happy you need to find the next one. On the other hand, this is an infinite game in which some surprise is always around the corner.
1. There is a gradient to follow. The next move is always almost obvious. Even when you get stuck with some part, the terrain is so wide that obvious improvements are always somewhere.
1. You are free to play. You don't need anyone's permission. Anyone can clone this repo. Your success depends only on yourself. The shortest path between two points is a straight line.
